# Simple Mario Game
This is my first game project! 

I made a simple Mario Game by myself in summer 2022 and I made everything such as the 3D models and 2D arts. I put fbx files, background image, and the icon of the game in the folders, and I made them through Blender and Procreate. 

If you want to play it, please download the whole file and run “Simple Mario Game!.exe”. You can press the right and left arrow keys to control the movement of Mario, and press space to jump. 

This is a pretty simplified version of Mario, so there is only one level in this game. Hope you like it!
